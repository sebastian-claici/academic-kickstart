I am a final year PhD student in the [Geometric Data Processing Group](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/gdpgroup/) at MIT. My research focus is on discrete optimal transport with applications to Bayesian inference, robust learning, clustering, and data summarization. During my time in GDP I’ve been lucky to collaborate with many incredible people, among them [Edward Chien](http://people.csail.mit.edu/eddchien/), [Matthew Staib](http://www.mit.edu/~mstaib/), [Hugo Lavenant](https://www.math.u-psud.fr/~lavenant/), Pierre Monteiller, [Charlie Frogner](http://www.mit.edu/~frogner/), [Mikhail Yurochkin](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~moonfolk/), [Farzaneh Mirzazadeh](https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=ibm-Farzaneh), and [Justin Solomon](http://people.csail.mit.edu/jsolomon/).

Prior to joining Justin’s group, I was a Master’s student with [Daniela Rus](http://danielarus.csail.mit.edu/) in the Distributed Robotics Lab where I worked on modular robotics and path planning. Before coming to MIT, I received my BSc from the University of Southampton in the United Kingdom under the supervision of [Klaus-Peter Zauner](https://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/people/kpz).

I have done internships in interpretability of deep learning at Google, semantic segmentation with Bosch Research and Technology Center, and user experience at EPFL in Lausanne.

In my spare time, I enjoy hiking, climbing, and [pontificating](#posts) on books I've read.
