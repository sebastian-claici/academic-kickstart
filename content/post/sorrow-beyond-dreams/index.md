“A Sorrow Beyond Dreams,” published in 1972, is Peter Handke’s account of his mother’s life following her suicide at the age of 51.

There are ways we would think to write about following the death of a loved one. There are feelings to contend with, memories to recount. But Handke’s history deals with the facts of his mother’s life in a detached manner, as of an observer sitting on the other side of a one way mirror. He writes of women born in rural 1920’s Austria:

>No possibilities, it was all settled in advance: a bit of flirtation, a few giggles, brief bewilderment, then the alien, resigned look of a woman starting to keep house again, the first children, a bit of togetherness after the kitchen work, from the start not listened to, and in turn listening less and less, inner monologues, trouble with her legs, varicose veins, mute except for mumbling in her sleep, cancer of the womb, and finally, with death, destiny fulfilled. The girls in our town used to play a game based on the stations in a woman's life: Tired/Exhausted/Sick/Dying/Dead.

If we do read emotion in Handke’s prose, it is most likely a feeling of impotent rage. His mother leaves her village for Vienna. The second world war is on the horizon; Hitler is welcomed in Austria; we are told he “had a nice voice”, and that everyone was

>“... kind of excited,” my mother told me. For the first time, people did things together. Even the daily grind took on a festive mood, “until late into the night.”

She falls in love and is left pregnant by a man who leaves the narrative as quickly as he came into it. She marries a German officer because he was there and because he proposed. I don’t mean to imply that these events happened in a blur, a flurry of emotions. They happened because they had to. Handke writes at the start

>Well then, it began with my mother being born more than fifty years ago in the same village where she died.

This story is not significant because Handke’s mother is a significant person in history, but because she is insignificant, and in her insignificance she stands for all those forgotten, those for whom life is a brief waiting for death:

>Today was yesterday, yesterday was always. Another day behind you, another week gone, and Happy New Year. What will we have to eat tomorrow? Has the mailman come? What have you been doing around the house all day?

Handke intersperses his own thoughts and feelings throughout the text. Towards the end of the book:

>It is not true that writing has helped me.... The air in the darkness is so still that, losing their balance, torn from their moorings, the things of my world fly soundlessly about: in another minute they will come crashing down from all directions and smother me. In these tempests of dread, I become magnetic like a decaying animal.

These thoughts are no longer an impersonal retelling, but Handke never dwells on his thoughts. He has feelings to write about, but his mother lived a life where feelings were few and alien. Perhaps this is how we should understand the title: not a sorrow beyond imagination or understanding, but a sorrow so pervasive and permanent that one cannot escape it even in dreams; “No possibilities, it was all settled in advance: … Tired/Exhausted/Sick/Dying/Dead.”
