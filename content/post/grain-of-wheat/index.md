Disclaimer: This review was unpleasant to write. It can be unpleasant to read.

1952 to 1960 mark the years of the Kenyan Emergency (or Mau Mau Uprising), a revolt and struggle for independence of native Kenyans who saw their ancestral land taken from them piece by piece by British colonizers. One Colonial Governor at the time summarizes British attitudes towards the land and its people:

>The greater part of the wealth of the country is at present in our hands. . . . This land we have made is our land by right—by right of achievement.

The events of the uprising are bleak, and few Kenyans escaped unscathed. Those that took an oath to support the rebel cause were gathered in labour camps and tortured. Those that did not were herded into villages and kept under constant surveillance.

Stories of life in the camps are hard to stomach. Prisoners were beaten and tortured without reprieve. A British man recounts with pride:

>We knew the slow method of torture [at the Mau Mau Investigation Center] was worse than anything we could do. Special Branch there had a way of slowly electrocuting a Kuke—they'd rough up one for days. Once I went personally to drop off one gang member who needed special treatment. I stayed for a few hours to help the boys out, softening him up. Things got a little out of hand. By the time I cut his balls off, he had no ears, and his eyeball, the right one, I think, was hanging out of its socket. Too bad, he died before we got much out of him.

Between 1945 and 1946, British judges sat in Nuremberg and passed judgement on war crimes committed by the Nazi regime. In 1952, Princess Elizabeth was crowned Queen Elizabeth II of England.

We can talk of the facts of the Kenyan Emergency. Hundreds of thousands died. Millions were herded into enclosed villages, and kept under constant surveillance. But facts are not the conduit for emotion; people are.

Written in 1967, *A Grain of Wheat* is Ngugi wa Thiong’o’s retelling of the story of Kenyan independence through the lives of a few characters living in or near the village of Thabai.

They are: Mugo, an orphan and hermit who finds himself thrust into prominence by his resilience during his time in the camps; Kihika, a young revolutionary leader who is betrayed by one of his own and hung by the British; Gikonyo, a carpenter and husband of Mumbi; John Thompson, a colonial administrator and proponent of British rule; Karanja, an aide to Thompson, and former rival of Gikonyo.

Their lives interleave as the tragedy of the Emergency unfolds through flashbacks told from each character’s point of view. Constant tensions run through the novel: Who betrayed Kihika? How has his wife changed during the six years Gikonyo spent in a concentration camp? What will Mugo do as he is thrust into a position of power he does not want?

These tensions parallel the uncertainty and violence of the Kenyan struggle for independence. They are recounted in prose that is itself abrupt and uncompromising. Events are described with an understanding that the brutality of violence is a more moving witness than sentimentalism:

>On the fourth day they marched forward, singing. The police who waited for them with guns fixed with bayonets, opened fire.

Ngugi does not moralize. It is a wonder that while we cannot (I hope) fully empathize with the suffering of these people, Ngugi makes us kin to their wants, their small victories and defeats. We believe the truth of this story because we believe in the reality of the characters.

It is easy to read the history of Kenya, its land and people, its joys and sufferings, in the lives of the novel’s main characters. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the rivalry between Gikonyo and Karanja for Mumbi’s love. Mumbi, a proud, beautiful, educated young woman from Thabai, embodies both the ancient purity of Kenya and the present hard-heartedness. Her choice of a husband is a choice for the future of Kenya. In her choice of Gikonyo, we see a rejection of colonial values and a return to a simple life.

Karanja and Gikonyo escape punishment during the Emergency, but they do so in different ways. Gikonyo rejects the oath he swore to the rebels, and betrays his own kind. Karanja goes a step beyond and works with the whiteman in an attempt to assimilate; he rises through the ranks to Chief, and is allowed to exert his power in colonial ways: he can arrest, beat, and torture blackmen.

For both, their actions are a means to an end, but the end is different. Gikonyo, having already won the love of Mumbi, wishes simply to return by her side. Karanja knows Mumbi will never love him, but wants nevertheless to exert power over her. There is a passage early on that illustrates the differences between Karanja and Gikonyo in their approach to playing guitar:

>Karanja played differently from Gikonyo. Gikonyo went into the instrument with a kind of dark fury. At times the instrument possessed him and his playing had crude power. But Karanja stood above the instrument; he controlled it, like the carpenter with his tools, so that his playing was more sure and more finished.

This parallels the conflict for Kenya between a people that want to live in harmony with the land, subject to both its bounties and its disasters, and a people that want to control and exploit. It is the folly of the colonizer to think that control is always desirable.

The novel opens with a quote from the Bible:

>Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die. And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain.

>I Corinthians 15:36

It ends in an image of hope. For us too, no matter who or where we are, what we have done or will do, there is hope of change. But for that grain of hope to flourish, we must leave something of ourselves behind.

It is poignant and important. It contains immeasurable sorrow, but also unbounded hope.
