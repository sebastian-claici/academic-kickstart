Is all life sacred? Where do we draw the line and should we impose that line on all around us? That’s the question at the heart of Tokarczuk’s novel.

On the surface, however, you have a murder mystery whodunit with a main character that's equally likeable and surprising. Janina Duszejko is old, ailing, and nosy. She teaches English, but spends most of her time making the rounds in her small remote neighborhood, making sure everything is just all right. I think of her as an overzealous grandmother. She translates Blake, has recurring nightmares, and obsesses over astrology tables.

Her neighbors start dying one by one, and no one can figure out why or who did it. Janina (or Ms. Duszejko, as she hates being called Janina) takes matters into her own hands.

So on the one hand we have the plot of a pulpy murder novel, and on the other hand we have capital L Literature (Tokarczuk won the 2018 Nobel prize). Do these goals collide? Well, no, not really, but nothing here excites or leaves a lasting impression.

To be sure, her prose is at times sharp, strong, and willful:

>Winter mornings are made of steel; they have a metallic taste and sharp edges. On a Wednesday in January, at seven in the morning, it’s plain to see that the world was not made for Man, and definitely not for his comfort or pleasure.

But other times it veers too much towards platitude. It is never unexpected. If you read this book with a highlighter, you would end up with a collection of Great Speech blurbs. Pretty yes; inspiring even; but also a bit empty and dead.

The book invites a comparison with Blake who shared many of the ideals of Janina (Tokarczuk). NPR thinks that perhaps this comparison is favorable to Tokarczuk (quote from Kamil Ahsan’s review for NPR):

>It may be worth to ask: Does Tokarczuk transcend Blake? Arguable — perhaps. Does she render the limits of human effort more viscerally than Blake? Arguable — perhaps.

I believe there are few places in literature where one can claim access to some objective truth. That said, the answer to both of those questions is “No”.
