A woman walks alone on a beautiful sunny fall day in the yard of some Oxbridge college. She is deep in thought. She does not notice that she’s stepped on the lawn, but a gentleman in a flurry of motion is there to remind her that the lawn can only be crossed by fellows and scholars. The thought is lost.

A woman wants to tell of her experience during World War II. She barely has time to sit down in front of her interviewer before her husband warns her: “Tell it the way I taught you. Without tears and women’s trifles.”

These small events hurt and anger us because we know the truth of them. We see such dismissive attitudes in our parents or grandparents, in our friends and neighbors, in ourselves. This understanding is enough to make us pause, consider, and change.

Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale has none of these qualities.

What we have instead is a story of white Catholic women oppressed beyond the wildest belief and an unreality so palpable that it would be a struggle to excise any semblance of real human experience from the pages of the novel.

The Handmaid’s Tale is the story of a woman. Her real name is never revealed, but we know her by the patronymic Offred. She is the property of Fred, her Commander. Her purpose is to conceive. Were she to fail repeatedly at this, she would be sent off to clean up radioactive material until the day she dies a lonely painful death. She lives -- if one can call it life -- in Gilead, a biblical name for a biblical place with biblical laws.

Gilead is a nation with an almost cartoonish revulsion for women, but a preternatural love of categorization. Capital case nouns march through the novel to remind us that this is Truth and Premonition. We see Wives, Marthas, Aunts, and Handmaidens, Commanders and Eyes and other terms that I forgot, but that are nonetheless there to remind you of something or another. Certainly this is a serious novel if it takes after the German language -- a serious language as we all know.

But how is this to be taken seriously? A group of machine gun wielding people storm the Whitehouse, kill the president, and establish a theocratic dictatorship of only white Catholic individuals where women are reduced to objects for use by the rich and powerful. There are places in the world where this has happened -- though it must be said not to the extent in the novel -- but those places are cultural opposites to the United States. This is lost on Atwood, however, who imagines from her house in the great Canadian north, as she puts pen to paper or finger to typewriter key, that the platonic ideal of the United States has always been the theocracy established by the Mayflower pilgrims in 1620.

Well, let’s follow along nonetheless. The revolution happens, the president is gunned down, and Gilead is established. Laws change slowly, but fast enough that Offred remembers the past when women had rights. After all, that was merely a decade ago. As Atwood says,

>Nothing changes instantaneously: in a gradually heating bathtub you'd be boiled to death before you knew it.

Slippery slopes require propitious conditions -- it must at least be wet and cold outside, -- and they do not hurl one through the action at rollercoaster speeds, but I digress. I am invested in this book, so I can will myself to suspend disbelief on this account.

The action takes place in Cambridge, which is somewhat baffling given the history of this town, but the image of dead bodies being displayed on the walls of Harvard yard is humorous enough that I won’t dwell too much on location.

In fact, let’s say I buy into the entire premise. Good, then. We have a nation; we have a barbarous rule of law; we have a patriarchal society of white Catholic people living in Massachusetts. We have Offred and her thoughts, her feelings, her fears (many) and hopes (few). Is the book then valuable?

I will concede that Atwood has a talent for writing, but her writing is good in the way that a tree in autumn or a new coat of paint on a wall is good: it exists and if you look at it closely you would even say it’s done well, but it never quickens the soul or excites the mind. There is some poetry to the prose every now and then, as for instance when Offred describes how things got to be so bad:

>We lived by ignoring. Ignoring isn’t the same as ignorance, you have to work at it. ... There were stories in the newspapers, of course, corpses in ditches or the woods, bludgeoned to death or mutilated, interfered with as they used to say, but they were about other women, and the men who did such things were other men. ... We lived in the gaps between the stories.

Or this when describing Fred as he is about to read a prayer to the household

>His manner is mild, his hands large, with thick fingers and acquisitive thumbs, his blue eyes uncommunicative, falsely innocuous. He looks us over as if taking inventory. One kneeling woman in red, one seated woman in blue, two in green, standing, a solitary man, thin-faced, in the background. He manages to appear puzzled, as if he can’t quite remember how we all got in here. As if we are something he inherited, like a Victorian pump organ, and he hasn’t figured out what to do with us. What we are worth.

This is good stuff. It’s stuff that you can hardly fault. Does it rate well against the writing of Morrison or Gordimer or Munro? No.

But perhaps we can see value in The Handmaid’s Tale as a warning of things to come; after all, Orwell is not the greatest prose writer either, but 1984 has become an icon of culture despite this. Unfortunately, Margaret Atwood seems so ensconced in her writing nook that she fails to see beyond the neatly trimmed hedge rows of her life into the lives of others less fortunate whose wants and sufferings cannot be so easily and neatly categorized. The truth of The Handmaid’s Tale is the shadow of an afterthought that there is indeed such suffering in the world and that we ought to be aware of it and fight it. But the book itself offers nothing but a droll fetishization of that oppression.

While readers of The Handmaid’s Tale are busy waging imaginary crusades against the Republic of Gilead, women in Saudi Arabia are stoned to death for adultery, girls in the Philippines are beaten to an inch of their life by their fathers, and teenagers are bartered off like commodities in India. I am glad that these realities have inspired Atwood to imagine a world where she too can be persecuted.
