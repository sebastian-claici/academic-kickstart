abstract = "We  consider  the  problem  of  monitoring  events occurring  at  discrete  locations  in  a  stochastic,  time-varying manner.  Our  problem  formulation  extends  prior  work  in  persistent surveillance by considering the objective of maximizing event detections in unknown, dynamic environments where the rates  of  events  are  time-inhomogeneous  and  may  be  subject to  abrupt  changes.  We  propose  a  novel  monitoring  algorithm that   effectively   strikes   a   balance   between   exploration   and exploitation as well as a balance between remembering and discarding information to handle temporal variations in unknown environments.  We  present  an  analysis  proving  the  long-run average  optimality  of  the  policies  generated  by  our  algorithm under  the  assumption  that  the  total  temporal  variations  are sub-linear.  We  present  simulation  results  demonstrating  the effectiveness  of  our  algorithm  in  several  monitoring  scenarios inspired by real-world applications, and its robustness to both continuous-random and abrupt changes in the statistics of the observed  processes."
