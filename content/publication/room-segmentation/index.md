abstract = "We present an automatic approach for the task of reconstructing a 2D floor plan from unstructured point clouds of  building  interiors.  Our  approach  emphasizes  accurate  and robust  detection  of  building  structural  elements,  and  unlike previous   approaches   does   not   require   prior   knowledge   of scanning device poses. The reconstruction task is formulated as a  multiclass  labeling  problem  that  we  approach  using  energy minimization. We use intuitive priors to define the costs for the energy  minimization  problem,  and  rely  on  accurate  wall  and opening detection algorithms to ensure robustness. We provide detailed  experimental  evaluation  results,  both  qualitative  and quantitative,   against   state   of   the   art   methods   and   labeled ground  truth  data."
