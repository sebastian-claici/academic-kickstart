abstract = "This  paper  presents  the  mechanical  design  of  a modular  robot  called  the  3D  M-Block,  a  50 mm  cubic  module capable of both independent and lattice-based locomotion. The first  M-Blocks  described  in  [1] could  pivot  about  one  axis  of rotation only. In contrast, the 3D M-blocks can exert on demand both  forward  and  backward  torques  about  three  orthogonal axes,  for  a  total  of  six  directions.  The  3D  M-Blocks  transform these torques into pivoting motions which allow the new 3D M- Blocks to move more freely than their predecessors. Individual modules  can  employ  pivoting  motions  to  independently  roll across   a   wide   variety   of   surfaces   as   well   as   to   join   and move  relative  to  other  M-Blocks  as  part  of  a  larger  collective structure. The 3D M-Block maintains the same form factor and magnetic bonding system as the one-dimensional M-Blocks [1], but  a  new  fabrication  process  supports  more  efficient  and precise  production.  The  3D  M-blocks  provide  a  robust  and capable  modular  self-reconfigurable  robotic  platform  able  to support  swarm  robot  applications  through  individual  module capabilities   and   self-reconfiguring   robot   applications   using connected lattices of modules."
